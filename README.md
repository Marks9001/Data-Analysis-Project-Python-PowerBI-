# Wargaming.net API Data Analysis Project

## Disclaimer
This is a World of Tanks video game analysis. All data has been extracted from Wargaming.net API [(link)](https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/all/wot/account/list/?r_realm=eu) using Python and then visualized in Power BI.

## Goal

Goal was to extract data of about 2200 accounts from Wargaming.net API and compare them to my personal account. Main questions to answer were:

- General understanding about sample population
- When the accounts were created? Distribution in time
- How many battles played?
- What is the most played tank in every tier?
- Which tank has the biggest win ratio?
- What is my top 10 most played tanks and their win ratios?



## Contents
The project consists of two parts - first is the data extraction from the API and preparing it for use (Python). Second is creating data model and visualising the data in PowerBI. 

All files are available for preview in 'src' folder and also accessible via below links:
