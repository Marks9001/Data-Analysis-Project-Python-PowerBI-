# Wargaming.net API Data Analysis Project

## Disclaimer
This is a World of Tanks video game analysis. All data has been extracted from Wargaming.net API [(link)](https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/all/wot/account/list/?r_realm=eu) using Python and then visualized in Power BI.

## Goal

Goal was to extract data of about 2200 accounts from Wargaming.net API and compare them to my personal account. Main questions to answer were:

- General understanding about sample population
- When the accounts were created? Distribution in time
- How many battles played?
- What is the most played tank in every tier?
- Which tank has the biggest win ratio?
- What is my top 10 most played tanks and their win ratios?
